This is a CNN model, and the structure of the model is derived from <b>RESNET-50</b>

<br>
What it does is, it takes an image of a pokemon as an input and tries to predict an appropriate name for that pokemon !!<br>
<br>
The dataset used in the training of the model is PokemonData(150 classes) from KAGGLE.<br>
<br>
The model has already been trained on gpu. Flask is used for the backend.<br>
